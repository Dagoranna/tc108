Tech Stack: Next.js, Redux

Clarifications on field formats:
For input fields, the color has been changed to purple (to resemble ink).

Date fields: where the original file had the format "___/____/___", a date picker was added. Where it was just a text string, the plain text format was kept.

The note about filling in with ink has been removed. The intermediate signature field and the date under the first page have been removed as well.

Instead of a signature line, a file upload option was added (potentially for a digital signature).
The date at the bottom has an initial value set to today’s date, but it is editable (I wasn’t sure here, perhaps it should have been non-editable).

At the top of the form, buttons have been added: Save, Import (as required in the task), and also Add attach, because in several places the form suggests attaching additional documents.
